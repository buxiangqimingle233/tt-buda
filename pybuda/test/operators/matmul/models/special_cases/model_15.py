        According to pytorch documention for Matmul: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.matmul.html
        with this model we are testing case: 
            - If both arguments are at least 1-dimensional and at least one argument is N-dimensional (where N > 2), then a batched matrix multiply is returned.
              If the first argument is 1-dimensional, a 1 is prepended to its dimension for the purpose of the batched matrix multiply and removed after.
              If the second argument is 1-dimensional, a 1 is appended to its dimension for the purpose of the batched matrix multiple and removed after. 
              The non-matrix (i.e. batch) dimensions are broadcasted (and thus must be broadcastable). For example, if input is a (J x 1 x N x N) tensor and other is a (K x N x N) tensor, out will be a (J x K x N x N) tensor. 
              Note that the broadcasting logic only looks at the batch dimensions when determining if the inputs are broadcastable, and not the matrix dimensions. 
              For example, if input is a (J x 1 x N x M) tensor and other is a (K x M x P) tensor, these inputs are valid for broadcasting even though the final two dimensions (i.e. the matrix dimensions) are different. out will be a (J x K x N x P) tensor.

        According to Test plan with this model we are testing:
            1. Op type: Matmul
            2. Operand source: From host
            3. Operand shapes: Full tensor (expected shape);
            4. Operand / output size of dimensions: Divisible by 32
            5. /
            6. /
