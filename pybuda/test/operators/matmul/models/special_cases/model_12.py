        According to pytorch documention for Matmul: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.matmul.html
        With this model we are testing case: 
            - If both arguments are 2-dimensional, the matrix-matrix product is returned.
        
        According to Test plan with this model we are testing:
            1. Op type: Matmul
            2. Operand source: From host
            3. Operand shapes: Full tensor (expected shape);
            4. Operand / output size of dimensions: Prime numbers
