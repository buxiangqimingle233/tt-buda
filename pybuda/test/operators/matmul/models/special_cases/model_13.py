        Buda Test 13

        According to pytorch documention for Matmul: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.matmul.html
        With this model we are testing case: 
            - If the first argument is 1-dimensional and the second argument is 2-dimensional,
              a 1 is prepended to its dimension for the purpose of the matrix multiply. After the matrix multiply, the prepended dimension is removed.

        According to Test plan with this model we are testing:
            1. Op type: Matmul
            2. Operand source: From host
            3. Operand shapes: Full tensor (expected shape);
            4. Operand / output size of dimensions: Prime numbers
            5. /
            6. /
